# CS147DVParser

This package is used to quickly convert CS147DV instructions into hexadecimal. It works with the 2019-2020 version of CS147DV instruction set. No guarantees are made it will work with the current version of the instruction set. 

The program was originally written in Java in the fall semester of 2019. The python implementation was created during the Fall 2020 version of the course.
Pull requests are encouraged. 

# How to use
The Java implemention of the program and instructions can be found in the CS147DVJavaParser folder.

The Python implementation and instructions can be found in CS147DVPyParser
